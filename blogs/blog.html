            <h2 class="text-center">localStorage Vs sessionStorage</h2>
            <p>localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs  and are near identical with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage  is only available for the duration of the browser session it does, however, survive page reloads Clearly, if the data you are storing needs to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing existence of data in either case</p>
            <p><span class="font-semibold">cookies:</span>  A cookie is a piece of data that a server sends in the HTTP response. The client stores the cookie and returns it on subsequent requests. This allows the client and server to share state. To set a cookie, the server includes a Set-Cookie header in the response.</p>
            <h3 class="text-center">localStorage vs. sessionStorage vs. Cookies</h3>
            <p>In terms of capabilities, cookies, sessionStorage, and localStorage only allow you to store strings - it is possible to implicitly convert primitive values when setting  but not Objects or Arrays . Session storage will generally allow you to store any primitives or objects supported by your Server Side language/framework.</p>

            3. What is an event loop ? How it works ? 
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. For example we can say Event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism through which the 'calls waiting for execution' in the callback queue/job queue can be put on the call stack . <br>
            <strong>How does the event loop work in JavaScript?</strong>
                <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process</p>

            4.What is a callback function and why will you use it?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p><b>Callback:</b>A callback function is a function passed as an argument of another function, which will
                be executed eventually. The callback function executes inside the main function and it is up to the main
                function to decide when to execute it</p>
            <p><b>why will you use it:</b>
                Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right
                after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from
                problems and errors</p>
